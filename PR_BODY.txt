## Summary

Implements flexible CLI argument handling with named options alongside existing positional arguments, and bumps version to 1.2.0 per approved plan.

## Changes

**CLI Enhancements** (`src/diff_utility/cli.py`):
- Help options: `/?` and `--?` now work alongside `--help`
- Named file inputs: `-file1`/`-1` for first file, `-file2`/`-2` for second file
- Output to file: `-output`/`-o` writes results to specified file instead of stdout
- Named arguments override positional when both provided (using explicit `is not None` checks)
- Backward compatible: all existing positional usage continues to work
- Enhanced error handling for output file write operations

**Example Usage**:
```bash
# Traditional positional still works
diff-utility file1.txt file2.txt

# New named arguments
diff-utility -1 file1.txt -2 file2.txt -o output.txt

# Override: compares file1 with file3 (not file2)
diff-utility file1.txt file2.txt -file2 file3.txt
```

**Version Management**:
- Bumped to 1.2.0 in `pyproject.toml`, `VERSION.txt`, `README.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`
- Added version bump checklist to `CODING_STANDARDS.md` §5.5 specifying the 4 files that must be updated

**Tests** (`tests/unit/diff_utility/test_cli.py`):
- Added 14 comprehensive tests covering help variants, named arguments, override behavior, file output, and error handling
- All 84 tests passing with 96.17% coverage (94.64% branch coverage)

**Documentation**:
- Moved planning documents to `Documentation/Records/` per CODING_STANDARDS.md §5.4

Please review and merge to main.
